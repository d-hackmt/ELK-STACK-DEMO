# ELK Stack Dynamics: Interactive Observability Platform

A premium, interactive web application designed to demonstrate the full lifecycle of logs in a cloud-native environment using the **ELK (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) Stack**.

Directed by **Divesh Jadhwani**

Developed by **Google Antigravity**
